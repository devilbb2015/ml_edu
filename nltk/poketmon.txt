One Pokemon GO player shares an intense encounter they had while using the game's new Powered-Up PokeStop feature to scan a real-life area.PokeStops are one of the most important gameplay aspects of Pokemon GO, so when changes are made to them, the whole game is affected. The recent addition of Powered-Up PokeStops, which take advantage of AR scanning technology, is already having an impact on Pokemon GO. However, one player claims that Niantic failed to take into account the social pressure around scanning a PokeStop in public.The new Powered-Up PokeStop feature allows players to temporarily power up a PokeStop and enhance the rewards gained by spinning it by teaming up to scan the real-life location the PokeStop is attached to using their smartphone cameras. This may seem relatively straightforward to gamers. However, as Pokemon GO is a game that requires players to go outside--often in public--there is a downside.RELATED: Pokemon GO Holiday 2021 Event Adding BergmiteReddit user p4755166 shared a story of trying to innocently scan a PokeStop and accidentally panning over a group of people.

They went on to report that this experience was so jarring to them that they don't intend to try out the Pokemon GO Powered-Up PokeStop feature again, even if they're in an area without onlookers to get confused.As of writing, it appears that other players are sympathetic to p4755166's experience. Several users stated that the Powered-Up PokeStop function is just Niantic trying to take advantage of players to gather data for future AR projects. Other users spoke triumphantly of how they managed to get around the AR scanning function, often by having it take pictures of the ground or the inside of their car instead of the PokeStop. Other users, however, stated that p4755166 should have just explained the situation.
